# 🚀 DASHBOARD with React + TypeScript + Vite

Welcome to my awesome dashboard project built with React, TypeScript, and Vite! 🪄

## Prerequisites

Before you can dive into this project, make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- Node.js 16.20+ 📦
- npm 8.19.4+ 📚

## Google Maps Integration

This system incorporates Google Maps API to ensure a seamless experience.

To get started, I recommend creating your Google Maps API key by visiting [Google Maps API Key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key?hl=pt-br).

to prevent common errors like 'This page can't load Google Maps correctly' or 'For development purposes only.' 🗺️

Once you have your API key, follow these steps:

1. Create a `.env` file at the top level of the `cred-dashboard` directory.
2. In the `.env` file, set up your environment variable:

   ```plaintext
   VITE_API_KEY='YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'
## How to Run the Application

To run the application on your computer, follow these simple steps:

1 . Install project dependencies
```js
npm install
  
```
2. Start the application

```js
npm run dev
  
```

That's it! Good Job! 🎉✨
